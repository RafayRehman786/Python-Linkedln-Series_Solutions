# Day02 answer

x = 5
y = x
x = 10
print(y)

# output is 5
'''When we write:

x = 5
y = x

Python copies the value 5 into y.
Later when we change:
x = 10

It does NOT change y, because y already stored 5.

So the final output is: 5 '''

🔥 Real-Life Analogy (Simple & Strong)

Think of it like this:

You write number 5 on two different papers.

Then you erase and change one paper to 10.

The other paper still has 5.

Variables work the same way.'''







# Now we add two numbers with help of variables 

#This Program adds two numbers
num1= 1
num2= 2
#add two numbers
sum = num1+num2
#display the sum

print("the sum of the numbers is :", sum) # how print variable


# Last day example solved with the help of variable 
Rafay = "Rafay_shazada" + "instagram id " +  "snapchat id " + "rafaygshazada "
print(Rafay) 


# Print the following code one by one ?
'''
1. What is the value of x in x = 5? # store 5 in variable called x


2. What is the value of result in result = 5 + 3? # print(result)

# how to input from the user 

# use input function  for take the input from the user  

# input is built in function in python that allow us take the input from the user on output screen 

# How to use :

a = (input("enter a number"))
b= (input("enter numeber "))

#practice:

# take the input from the user and then print (a) # remember one thing input default a string number 
# take the input from the user and then print (b)

# add two number using variables
a = int(input("enter number 1"))
b = int(input("enter number 2"))
print("number a is: ",a)
print("number b is: ",b)
print("sum is" , a + b)
